This repository contains code for different versions of tic-tac-toe written in python.

The brief for the project is as follows;

Hi Team ..I have an assignment for you .So Remember the game 'X and O ' ? I need you to write a python code  for that .

 If we were to set up a Tic-Tac-Toe game, we would want to know whether the board's current state is solved, wouldn't we? Our goal is to create a function that will check that for us!

 Assume that the board comes in the form of a 3x3 array, where the value is 0 if a spot is empty, 1 if it is an "X", or 2 if it is an "O", like so:

 [[0, 0, 1],
  [0, 1, 2],
  [2, 1, 0]]
 We want our function to return:

 -1 if the board is not yet finished AND no one has won yet (there are empty spots),
 1 if "X" won,
 2 if "O" won,
 0 if it's a cat's game (i.e. a draw).
 You may assume that the board passed in is valid in the context of a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

So with this exercise , topics to be covered are :
-Writing functions 
-Mathematical methods
-Loops
-Arrays and their methods
